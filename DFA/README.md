# Deterministic Finite Automata

- we'll use a text file to give all input so that we dont have to reload the inputs in the program
- sample test file

```
3       -> No of states
1       -> initial state
3       -> final state(s)
1 a 2   -> transition : state 1 to state 2 if letter = a
1 b 1
2 b 3
2 a 2
3 b 1
3 a 2
```
